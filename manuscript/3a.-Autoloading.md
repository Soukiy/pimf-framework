# Autoloading

Your application's PHP classes autoloading lives a the **autoload.app.php** file. All classes in PIMF are statically mapped. It's just a simple array of class to file path maps for ultra-fast file loading. Feel free to change the mappings and directories at **autoload.app.php** file.

Mappings from class names to file paths:

```php
 static $mappings = array(
      'MyFirstBlog\\Controller\\Blog'  => '/MyFirstBlog/Controller/Blog.php',
      'MyFirstBlog\\DataMapper\\Entry' => '/MyFirstBlog/DataMapper/Entry.php',
      'MyFirstBlog\\Model\\Entry'      => '/MyFirstBlog/Model/Entry.php'
    );
```

The core's PHP classes autoloading lives a the autoload.core.php file. **Note: this file is autogenerated with PHPAB - please do not edit!!!**
