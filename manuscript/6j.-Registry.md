# Registry

A well-known object that other objects can use to find common objects and services. Acts also as a dependency injection container. **Note that storing resources in a registry is not permitted!**

Common access

```php
 $registry = new Pimf\Registry();
 $registry->your_key = "123";
```

Static access

```php
 Pimf\Registry::set('your_key', "123")
 Pimf\Registry::get('your_key')
```

Following objects are directly accessible and come out of the box:

**conf** represents the configuration list.

```php
 $conf = Pimf\Registry::get('conf')
```

**env** represents [Pimf\Environment](https://github.com/gjerokrsteski/pimf/blob/master/core/Pimf/Environment.php) object which delivers methods for server and execution environment information.

```php
 $env = Pimf\Registry::get('env')
```

**logger** represents [Pimf\Logger](https://github.com/gjerokrsteski/pimf/blob/master/core/Pimf/Logger.php) object which delivers methods for common logging options into a file.

```php
 $logger = Pimf\Registry::get('logger')
```

**em** represents [Pimf\EntityManager](https://github.com/gjerokrsteski/pimf/blob/master/core/Pimf/EntityManager.php) object which delivers methods for data persistence and object relational mapping.

```php
 $em = Pimf\Registry::get('em')
```
