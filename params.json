A thin PHP framework with minimal installation configuration as well as being easy to learn? PIMF is about to satisfy your demands!\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n---------------\r\nThis repository contains the core code of the PIMF framework. If you want to build an application using PIMF, please use one of the quick-start bundles below.\r\n\r\nQuickstart with PIMF-Blog bundle using SQLite\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nThis Blog is a run-ready bundle which uses PIMF framework and includes a blog application based on the SQLite database.

This guide details all aspects of the framework and how to apply them to your application. http://docs.pimf-framework.de\r\n\r\nRead the PIMF Starter book almost anywhere. Available as a PDF, EPUB, and MOBI. You can now read it on all devices, as well as offline: http://book.pimf-framework.de\r\n\r\nPIMF Philosophy\r\n---------------\r\nMost PHP frameworks are bigger than the problem you are trying to solve. A big and complex framework can't protect you from poor business logic, and will often become a large part of your problem. Often you need 20% or less from the functionality of a full-stack framework to solve your problem. Therefore finding the right 20% of the framework functionality solves the remaining 80% of your problem. PIMF is an opinionated framework which follows common best practises that strives to be those right 20%.\r\n\r\nPIMF was first created for our own personal use. The aim was to deliver robust and secure projects fast. We just wanted one easy framework, which could be used for all of our projects. And then - PIMF was born!\r\n\r\nPIMFâ€™s implementation is based on well proven design patterns as well as fast object relation mapping mechanisms. PIMF is designed to be upgrade friendly - so that you can upgrade to newer versions with minimal effort.\r\n\r\nFramework Sponsor\r\n-------------------\r\nJetBRAINS supports the development of PIMF with PHPStorm licenses and we feel confident that PHPStorm strongly reinforces PIMF's quality. Use PHPStorm! http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThe PIMF framework is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\r\n",
